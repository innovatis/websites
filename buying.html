 			      <h1>For Buyers</h1>
 			      <h2>Let me help you every step of the way.</h2>
            <p>When buying or building a home, you are faced with a multitude of decisions! Locating the perfect home is not always an easy task, and obtaining a mortgage loan can be a complex and tiring process. Although, once you have determined that you are ready to move forward with the required effort towards your home-building goal, the rewards are unquestionable.</p>

            <p>While at your side each step of the way, I will make the process of buying/building a home easier, more enjoyable, less time-consuming, and less expensive than if you undertook this challenge on your own. I will help you prepare so that sellers perceive you as a preferred buyer, help you locate and assess floor plans that match your specifications, and help you through the myriad of details attending the actual purchase.</p>

            <div class="content-green">
              <h2>Your First Step</h2>
              <p>Your first step to building a home is to first ask yourself why you want to build a home: to stop paying rent? To start building equity? To have a place of your own? To raise a family? To entertain business associates? To move up to a bigger house? Next, list what kind of home you’d like and where you would like to be. Be specific. Separate the "must haves" from the "want to haves."</p>
              <p>Think of yourself as zeroing in on a target, going from the general to the specific. Consider area (city, suburban neighborhood, country); community (north, south, east, or west side); neighborhood (a particular school zone; recreational facilities; and other community services such as transportation, day care, library, stores, entertainment). Ask yourself how many minutes you are willing to commute to work.</p>
              <p>Think about home styles. How much space do you need? Does your situation require a one-level home, or are stairs acceptable? Consider size and kind of property. Someday you or your heirs will want to sell. Consider how long you expect to live in this particular home.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-green">
              <h2>Your Next Step? Loan Pre-Qualification</h2>
              <p>Once you have addressed the above needs, your next step in the purchasing process is to get pre-qualified with a mortgage company. This can be done over the phone or even online in a matter of minutes.</p>
              <p>Call me and I will refer you to a mortgage professional that has an excellent reputation and track record for successfully acquiring loan approval for his/her clients.</p>
