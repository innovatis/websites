        %h4 To all those in need of service,
        %p I have been managing in this business for 13 years and one of the most challenged areas of my business over the years has been television and music. I have dealt with many companies, some good, some bad, but then I met Tony, Ron and John from On-Q Pro Media. Over the last year I have been working with On-Q and have been blown away by the level of service that we have received. I have been using them as a music provider as well as using their services to assess my hardware needs. Any problems that I have encountered have been addressed immediately and efficiently. Their honesty and professionalism has been over the top and my system has never sounded better.

        %p Our Smitty's restaurants have recently undergone a complete renovation. We've been searching for a company that could not only take care of our renovation requirements by supplying audio and video for our locations, but also supply our background music needs as well. We found On-Q Pro Media. Their team of professionals have been able to supply and install our locations with the latest in audio and video. Their systems are very user friendly and provide us with a tremendous amount of flexibility.
        %p With our ever changing demographics we are now able to provide a variety of options to our customers that we were not able to do in the past.

        %p When we decided to open up Winnipeg's Premier Sports Bar we were looking for a company that had our same vision. After talking to several companies we chose On-Q Pro Media. They gave us suggestions and direction to take our concept to a new level. They not only took care of our audio and video needs but also took care of setting up our IT infrastructure including WiFi access and provided support, suggestions and troubleshooting while we implemented our POS and interac systems. The installation team was friendly and very efficient. The entire installation was very complex and required communication with the contractors to coordinate the project. We found On-Q Pro Media to be very professional and cooperative.
        %p After the installation was complete they took the time to demonstrate to our staff the flexibility and daily use procedures of our new system. The after sales service and response time has been great.
        %p If you are planning a renovation or have a conceptual idea that requires some input I would highly recommend the professionals at On-Q Pro Media.
