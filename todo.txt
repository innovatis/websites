    [ ] multi popup usability problem
        -more then one button referencing a single popup angers

    Each * when clicked opens a popup with * as the title, and the list
    bellow as content, it could be the case that a paragraph exists.

    Each of the popups will work for any * clicked on any scene.

    Each of these popups also needs a button "more info >> " that when clicked,
    takes the user to the services page, and scrolls them down to the
    correct section.
