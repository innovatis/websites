              <li><strong>Burley Sandwich</strong> This rich burley blend is pressed before cutting to give it a rubbed-flake appearance and a density in smoking that assures coolness.

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Black Shag</strong> Sherlock Holmes kept it in the toe of a Persian slipper nailed to the mantelpiece. It was dry and strong. Kept at what we today have deduced to be proper smoking moisture and smoked gently, this excellent stoved shag will provide hours of smoking pleasure. Examined the ash carefully.                                                                                                              </li>
              <li><strong>Arcadia</strong> It was said to be of such arresting character and delicacy that it stopped all conversation. Holmes recognized it by its characteristic fluffy, white ash.

This tranquil blend is topped off with a refined maple flavouring for a full flavour that is the talk of the town. Big flakes of bright Virginia add a calmly audacious note. </li>
              <li><strong>Tastemaster</strong> is a first-rate chocolate-flavoured tobacco. It is genteel on the palate, and abundantly flavourful throughout owing to the excellence of the superior tobaccos chosen for this masterful blend.</li>
              <li><strong>Best Of Show</strong> is a blue-ribbon blend of America’s finest tobaccos. You’ll judge it full-flavoured, satisfying, and mild. We have polished it off with nougat flavouring. It’s tastefully opulent and a winner. </li>
              <li><strong>Easy Street</strong> has a whisper of English Walnut which perfects this elegant Black Cavendish. It’s cool as the coolest jazz, soft as velvet nights, rich and creamy. Smoke it and you’ll be on Easy Street. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Royal Cajun Series</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Royal Cajun Ebony</strong> is black, smooth, sweet, smoky and absolutely rich. This blend of Virginias and Kentucky leaf demonstrates the magic that occurs when flue-curing; stoving, fire curing and Perique-style processing meet in a gloriously complex explosion of flavour. </li>

              <li><strong>Royal Cajun Dark</strong> is a blend of five exceptional red and stoved Virginias seasoned liberally with cool, subtly smoky Cajun Black. It is an incredible smoking experience, deeply rich in flavour, compelling in aroma, and yet exquisitely mild on the palate. </li>

              <li><strong>Royal Cajun Special</strong> is created from two dark stoved Virginias and one wide-cut lemon Virginia expertly blended with Cajun Black. This blend is one of a kind, ethereally smoky, deeply rich and incredibly complex. Cajun Black’s fire curing and Perique-style fermentation cool the Virginia’s natural sweetness. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Grand Orientals</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Classic Samsun</strong> grows in the Black Sea region of Eastern Turkey. We have secured the finest Samsun Maden-Canek leaves. They are small, thin and elastic with a mellow, pleasant, distinctive aroma. Their sweet taste is like the sweetness in a nutmeat or sunflower seed. They come from the hinterland of Samsun, mainly to the west of the Yesih Irmak river delta where the climate is very similar to the best Macedonian and Thracian growing areas. Samsun and all classic Oriental leaves are picked one-by-one, as they ripen, like flue-cured Virginias. If picked too soon so that the sap remains in the leaf during air and sun drying, the sugars will evaporate with the sap. If allowed to ripen too much on the plant, the leaf will be dry and shatter. Tobacco farmers of the classic Samsun growing areas have elevated these harvesting and curing processes to high art. In this blend taste what comes of 350 years of experience. </li>
              <li><strong>Katerini Classic</strong> comes from a very important tobacco producing area southwest of Thessalonica on mountain slopes of mainland Greece. The small, heart-shaped leaf that takes the area’s name and makes it legendary is grown from Samsun seed. Katerini leaf is light golden in colour, delicate, elastic, porous and robust. It has a subtler aroma than Samsun but notice its especially sweet, mild curry-like flavour in this fine blend. </li>
              <li><strong>Yenidje Supreme / Yenidje Highlander Oriental</strong> tobacco cultivation began in the 1600’s around the villages of Yenidje and Kirdzhali after Venetian and Genoese traders introduced tobacco smoking to the area in the 1500’s. The classic Basma seed introduced there over 300 years ago is believed by some to derive from an ancient Venezuelan variety of Nicotiana Tabacum named Barinas. The very finest Xanthi still comes from the original Yenidje ( Genesala ) area of Western Thrace just north of the modern town of Xanthi. It is the Xanthi-Djebel-Basma that comprises the legendary Yenidje leaf, which is thin, full-bodied, and flexible, with fine veins. Full of oils, the best leaves are quite small, yellow to brown in colour, with a pleasant, delicate aroma and sweet, mild, fresh flavour. Taste these blends (Supreme without Latakia, Highlander with Latakia) and discover why this particular classic Xanthi with its refreshing sweetness is known as “The Queen of Tobaccos”. </li>

              <li><strong>Black Sea Soukhoum</strong> is grown on the mountain slopes in Georgia beyond the far Eastern shore of the Black Sea. It is considered by many to be among the finest Oriental tobaccos grown. Soukhoum is a strain of Samsun seed and the leaves have the appearance of Samsun and share a very similar aroma, but notice how the flavour has a quality that is almost cigar-like, rich and deep and mellow in this blend. Soukhoum is the Easternmost of the classic Orientals. </li>

              <li><strong>Yenice Agonya</strong> is the famous Turkish tobacco from the Sea of Marmara district of Yenice which lies to the southeast of Canakhale. This is the anciently famous area of Troy or Ilium south of the Hellespont. The Hamdibey or Agonya district plants the Agonya seed, a Kabakulak variety of Xanthi origin. Agonya leaves are wide, fine-textured, and oval with bare stems. This blend is designed to highlight Agonya’s mellow taste and subtle fragrance.</li>
              <li><strong>Drama Reserve</strong> is sweet and subtle with a natural olive oil-like fragrance. It is grown on the Southern slopes and foothills of the Rhodope Mountains, the classic Drama Basma District in Greek Eastern Macedonia, and it includes the renowned Mahalla tobacco as about 25% of the blend. It is refreshing, delicate, and intriguing. This blend is designed ( without Latakia ) to demonstrate just why the classic top-grade Drama leaf is so celebrated.</li>
              <li><strong>Smyrna No. 1</strong> is made from tiny, No. 1 grade tobacco leaves from mountainous Western Turkey across from the island of Khios. They have long been prized as the most aromatic of all Orientals. They grow dense and extremely fragrant in this dry country moistened by Mediterranean Sea breezes. Look for a whole Smyrna leaf on top of the tobacco when you open the tin. Notice the tiny hole where it was strung up by hand to air cure in a time-honoured, labour-intensive process. There is no Latakia in this blend. Smyrna is the defining ingredient in this sophisticated Oriental tobacco. Our intention here is to spotlight the character of this extraordinary, delicate leaf.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Collector Blends</h4>
            <ul>

              <li><strong>Tudor Castle</strong> is a beautifully balanced blend of sugary bright Virginia, a good amount of rare No. 1 Grade Yenidje, red Virginia and a nice touch of St. James Perique. It is a great smoke today and should age and mellow beautifully in the tin.</li>

              <li><strong>Tudor Castle Arcade</strong> begins by being pressed into cakes, and aged to perfection.

Three Oaks matures gracefully, developing sweetness and additional complexity.</li>
              <li><strong>Three Oaks Syrian</strong> is made from rare Syrian Latakia, with its renowned mellow smokiness, and balanced with naturally sweet Oriental tobaccos and aged Virginia leaf to create a satisfying blend reminiscent of classic Syrian Latakia of old.</li>

              <li><strong>Legends</strong> is made using a generous portion of rich, top-quality Cyprian Latakia which provides support and structure for dark stoved and red Virginas, deftly combined with Orientals, including Mahalla and the finest Drama. It is reminiscent of the legendary, complex blends of times gone by, and is a smooth, and deeply smoky ribbon-cut blend that tastes at once bold and subtle. It is creamy with soft, quiet background hints of plum or currant.</li>

              <li><strong>Wilderness</strong> is a remarkable blend that provides a multi-layered, rich taste experience. The highest quality Syrian Latakia combines with small amounts of Cyprian to form the base for an exquisite array of rare and precious Orientals, sweet Drama, exotic Yenidje, and more. Red Virginias complement the blend, adding sweetness, richness, strength, and creaminess. Smoke this mixture and listen for the echoes of savoured memories.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Ashton Blends</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Black Parrot</strong> is a balanced blend with Virginia, Carolina and pure Louisiana Perique.

              <li><strong>Pebblecut</strong> is made from selected red mottled leaf from Carolina, rich in flavour and oils, small Oriental leaves from Macedonia of piquant aroma, bright nut-flavoured broad leaf from Virginia, and pure Louisiana Perique which all combine to form the framework of this blend which is then hard-pressed and lightly stoved to smooth and enrich. Pebblecut long-flake pipe tobacco is savoury with a concert of ever-changing flavours, always intriguing, never dull. </li>

              <li><strong>Old Dog</strong> is one of the most loved items in this series. This is a full English mixture, dark with cool, smoky Cyprian Latakia, and spiced with fragrant Xanthi from Macedonia. These tobaccos marry under with aged, sweet flue-cured Virginas and smooth jet-black Cavendish to create a very rich, satisfying blend with a tin aroma that is incredibly appealing. You might want to sit back comfortably to ponder the meaning of life with Old Dog as your companion.</li>

              <li><strong>Brindle Flake</strong> captures the natural sweetness of the fine Virginia tobaccos in this flavourful blend by flue curing them. Aging in cakes softens them into elegance. This partially rubbed flake harkens back to English days of old. It burns with regal restraint to a mottled white ash. It is a friend with strong character and considerable charm.</li>

              <li><strong>Oldchurch</strong> is an aromatic pipe tobacco of incredible delicacy. We spice this Matured Virginia with zesty Carolina and cake-age the blend for an added measure of smoothness before spinning into ribbon form and adding jet-black Cavendish for depth and richness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Limited Edition</h4>
            <ul>

            <h3>Tips for Enhanced Smoking Pleasure</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Filling Your Pipe:</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Always fill your pipe in layers. An evenly, firmly packed pipe will burn slower and cooler. When this is done right you should have some resistance when you draw air through the stem. Imagine the resistance you meet when drinking a milkshake. </li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong>Lighting Your Pipe:</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>An even light can only be obtained by lighting three times. Light your pipe as uniformly as possible, lightly tamp the tobacco and light your pipe again. On the third light you might notice the flame from the match seem to “jump up” from the tobacco. This is a good sign that you have lit it properly and it should burn as a surface. </li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong>Smoking Your Pipe:</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>You want slow cool smoke. Draw gently on your pipe and savor the flavour of the tobacco. Relax and enjoy the moment. Remember, pipes are to be tasted, not inhaled. </li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong>Caring for Your Pipe:</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Keep your pipe clean and sweet smoking. Use pipe cleaners frequently to remove any residue and always empty your pipe of all ash and any unused tobacco as soon as you are done smoking.</li>
              </ul>
