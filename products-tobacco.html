              <li><strong>Northern Comfort</strong> A really distinctive Virginia flake that will satisfy many aromatic smokers who have been sacrificing cleanness of burning to obtain a sweet aroma. It is often found preferable by those who have been smoking the various sweet, black tobaccos, traditional aromatic cavendishes, and many standard aromatics because of its cooler, dryer smoking qualities and its natural tobacco taste.                                                                </li>

              <li><strong>Perique</strong> Rare and precious, this dark, fragrant condiment tobacco - cured in wooden casks - is from St. James Parish, Louisiana, where it has been produced in time-honored fashion since the days when the natives pressed it in tree trunks. Use it sparingly in your blends for its distinctive aroma and cool smoking character. </li>

              <li><strong>Dark Star</strong> Years before tinning, this tobacco begins as bright yellow, sugary top-grade Virginia and Carolina leaf.

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Black Shag</strong> Sherlock Holmes kept it in the toe of a Persian slipper nailed to the mantelpiece. It was dry and strong. Kept at what we today have deduced to be proper smoking moisture and smoked gently, this excellent stoved shag will provide hours of smoking pleasure. Examined the ash carefully.                                                                                                                    </li>

            <h3>Tips for Enhanced Smoking Pleasure</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Filling Your Pipe:</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Always fill your pipe in layers. An evenly, firmly packed pipe will burn slower and cooler.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong>Lighting Your Pipe:</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>An even light can only be obtained by lighting twice. Light your pipe as uniformly as possible, lightly tamp the tobacco and light your pipe again.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong>Smoking Your Pipe:</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>You want slow cool smoke. Draw gently on your pipe and savor the flavor of the tobacco. Relax and enjoy the moment. Remember, pipes are to be tasted, not inhaled.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong>Caring for Your Pipe:</strong></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Keep your pipe clean and sweet smoking. Use pipe cleaners frequently to remove any residue and always empty your pipe of all ash and any unused tobacco as soon as you are done smoking.</li>
