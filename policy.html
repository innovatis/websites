                            reassessment limitations periods
                            imposed by tax legislation, to comply
                            with our insurance requirements, and as
                            otherwise required to comply with
                            applicable laws. In general, we will
                            retain client files and personal
                            information therein for a period of 7

                            When we no longer have any use for the
                            personal information, we dispose of it
                            by having it shredded or destroyed in
