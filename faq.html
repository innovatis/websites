            <h1>Prices: </h1>
            <p>Our prices as a rule are half of new OEM. Sometimes very rare pieces are of more value, but in most cases our recycled parts are 50% to 90% off of new OEM.</p>
            <h1>Can we pull off our own parts?</h1>
            <p> Most of our parts are on the shelf, ready to go. Sometimes the part you need is still on the vehicle. In this case we will be glad to remove it for you. Our insurance does not allow non-employees to work on cars in our yard. </p>
            <h1>Are all parts reusable?</h1>
            <p>While 90% of the vehicles are reuseable, some parts, such as steering tie rods, brake pads, and water pumps, we do not recommend resuing. That is why we stock a full line of new aftermarket parts at our Winnipeg warehouse. For more information, see the new parts tab on this site! </p>
